     * Input messages.
     *
     * Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational turns.
     * When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the `messages`
     * parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive
     * `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.
     *
     * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a single
     * `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
     *
     * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
     * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
     * model's response.
     *
     * Example with a single `user` message:
     * ```json
     * [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
     * ```
     *
     * Example with multiple conversational turns:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
     *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
     *   { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
     * ```json
     * [
     *   {
     *     "role": "user",
     *     "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
     *   },
     *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
     * ]
     * ```
     *
     * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content blocks,
     * where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is shorthand for an
     * array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input messages are equivalent:
     * ```json
     * { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
     * ```
     * ```json
     * { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
     * ```
     *
     * Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "role": "user",
     *   "content": [
     *     {
     *       "type": "image",
     *       "source": {
     *         "type": "base64",
     *         "media_type": "image/jpeg",

     *     { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" }
     *   ]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * We currently support the `base64` source type for images, and the `image/jpeg`, `image/png`,
     * `image/gif`, and `image/webp` media types.
     *

         * `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the
         * conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined
         * into a single turn.
         *
         * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
         * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
         *
         * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
         * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
         * model's response.
         *
         * Example with a single `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
         * ```

         *   { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
         *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },

         *
         * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
         * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
         * shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input

         * If you include `tools` in your API request, the model may return `tool_use` content
         * blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using
         * the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the
         * model using `tool_result` content blocks.
         *
         * Each tool definition includes:
         * - `name`: Name of the tool.
         * - `description`: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
         * - `input_schema`: [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12) for the tool
         *   `input` shape that the model will produce in `tool_use` output content blocks.
         *
         * For example, if you defined `tools` as:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "name": "get_stock_price",

         *       "type": "object",
         *       "properties": {
         *         "ticker": {
         *           "type": "string",

         *   }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
         * `tool_use` content blocks in the response like this:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "type": "tool_use",
         *     "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
         *     "name": "get_stock_price",
         *     "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
         *   }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * You might then run your `get_stock_price` tool with `{"ticker": "^GSPC"}` as an input,
         * and return the following back to the model in a subsequent `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "type": "tool_result",

         *   }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or
         * more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of
         * output.

             * conversational turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior
             * conversational turns with the `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the
             * next `Message` in the conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your
             * request will be combined into a single turn.
             *
             * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
             * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant`
             * messages.
             *
             * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
             * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of
             * the model's response.
             *
             * Example with a single `user` message:
             * ```json
             * [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
             * ```
             *
             * Example with multiple conversational turns:
             * ```json
             * [
             *   { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
             *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
             *   { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
             * ]

             *     "role": "user",
             *     "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"

             *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
             * ]
             * ```
             *
             * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
             * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
             * shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input
             * messages are equivalent:
             * ```json
             * { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }

         *
         * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
         * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
         *
         * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
         * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
         * model's response.
         *
         * Example with a single `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]

         *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },

         * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content

         *
         * Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational
         * turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the
         * `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the
         * conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined
         * into a single turn.
         *
         * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
         * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
         *
         * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
         * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
         * model's response.
         *
         * Example with a single `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with multiple conversational turns:

         *   { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
         *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },

         *
         * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
         * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is

         * Input messages.
         *
         * Our models are trained to operate on alternating `user` and `assistant` conversational
         * turns. When creating a new `Message`, you specify the prior conversational turns with the
         * `messages` parameter, and the model then generates the next `Message` in the
         * conversation. Consecutive `user` or `assistant` turns in your request will be combined
         * into a single turn.
         *
         * Each input message must be an object with a `role` and `content`. You can specify a
         * single `user`-role message, or you can include multiple `user` and `assistant` messages.
         *
         * If the final message uses the `assistant` role, the response content will continue
         * immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the
         * model's response.
         *
         * Example with a single `user` message:
         * ```json
         * [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with multiple conversational turns:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   { "role": "user", "content": "Hello there." },
         *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?" },
         *   { "role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?" }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
         * ```json
         * [
         *   {
         *     "role": "user",
         *     "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"
         *   },
         *   { "role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is (" }
         * ]
         * ```
         *
         * Each input message `content` may be either a single `string` or an array of content
         * blocks, where each block has a specific `type`. Using a `string` for `content` is
         * shorthand for an array of one content block of type `"text"`. The following input
         * messages are equivalent:
         * ```json
         * { "role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude" }
         * ```
         * ```json
         * { "role": "user", "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude" }] }
         * ```
         *
         * Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:
         * ```json
         * {
         *   "role": "user",

         *     {
